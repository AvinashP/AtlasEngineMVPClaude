# Project: AtlasEngine MVP

## Overview
AtlasEngine is an AI-powered full-stack development platform with persistent memory, similar to Replit but with Claude Code integration. The platform allows users to build applications through AI chat, with live previews and one-click deployments.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js 20.x + Express.js + Socket.io
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Containerization**: Docker with security hardening
- **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy (auto SSL + wildcard)
- **AI**: Claude Code CLI (Anthropic API)
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Build Queue**: Redis
- **Hosting**: Oracle Cloud Free Tier (ARM VM)

## Architecture
- **Three-tier architecture**: Frontend (React SPA) → Backend (Express API) → Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Builder/Runner separation**: Untrusted build containers isolated from runtime containers
- **Origin isolation**: Previews served on separate subdomains (proj-*.domain.com)
- **Memory system**: CLAUDE.md files for persistent AI context across sessions
- **Security zones**: Docker networks isolate user containers from system components

## Key Decisions
- **2025-10-19**: Project initialized - chosen custom React implementation over ClaudeCodeUI fork to avoid GPL-3.0 viral licensing
- **2025-10-19**: Decided on security-first architecture with mandatory quota enforcement (not optional)
- **2025-10-19**: Implementing CLAUDE.md memory system as core differentiator from competitors
- **2025-10-19**: Using wildcard subdomains for preview isolation to prevent XSS attacks
- **2025-10-20**: Completed full-stack implementation - 20+ backend files, 15+ frontend components
- **2025-10-20**: Created comprehensive testing suite with automated E2E script
- **2025-10-20**: MVP uses simulated Claude responses - production will use real Anthropic API
- **2025-10-20**: Prioritized testing over remaining features (auth, templates, janitor) per user request

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety (frontend and backend where applicable)
- Async/await pattern for all asynchronous operations
- Error handling: Try-catch blocks with proper error logging
- File organization: Services for business logic, routes for API endpoints, middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Database queries: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Environment variables: Never commit .env files, use .env.example templates
- Comments: Inline comments for complex logic, JSDoc for function documentation

**✅ MVP CORE FEATURES: 13/18 COMPLETE (72%)**

Phase 1 MVP progress against Planning/atlas-mvp-plan.md checklist:

**✅ Completed (13/18):**
1. Custom frontend (React+TypeScript, NOT ClaudeCodeUI fork)
2. Chat with Claude Code to build apps (streaming + tool visibility)
3. CLAUDE.md memory system (init/update/checkpoint/stats)
4. File tree + code editor (Monaco)
5. Live preview system (static + Docker previews with auto-refresh)
6. Docker-based deployment (builder/runner split with security hardening)
8. Project persistence (PostgreSQL with full schema)
10. Memory persistence across sessions (CLAUDE.md + snapshots)
11. ENFORCED resource quotas (hard stops via middleware)
12. Rate limiting & cost tracking (usage ledger)
13. Container security hardening (non-root, read-only FS, seccomp, etc.)
14. Port allocator + health checks (/health endpoint)
15. Minimal observability (events table + Winston structured logs)

**⚠️ Partial (1/18):**
7. Build orchestration (works but no Redis queue - builds execute directly)

**❌ Pending (4/18):**
9. Session management (JWT auth - currently mock auth)
16. Janitor service (nightly cleanup of containers/images/volumes)
17. Starter templates (Next.js, Vite+React, Express, Flask)
18. Debug surface (/debug page for ops)

**Recent Enhancements (2025-10-21):**
- ✅ Auto-refresh system for file explorer and preview on file changes
- ✅ Claude directory restriction system (prevents AI from modifying AtlasEngine codebase)
- ✅ Static file preview server (serves HTML/CSS/JS directly from project directories)

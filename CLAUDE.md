# Project: AtlasEngine MVP

## Overview
AtlasEngine is an AI-powered full-stack development platform with persistent memory, similar to Replit but with Claude Code integration. The platform allows users to build applications through AI chat, with live previews and one-click deployments.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js 20.x + Express.js + Socket.io
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Containerization**: Docker with security hardening
- **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy (auto SSL + wildcard)
- **AI**: Claude Code CLI (Anthropic API)
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Build Queue**: Redis
- **Hosting**: Oracle Cloud Free Tier (ARM VM)

## Architecture
- **Three-tier architecture**: Frontend (React SPA) → Backend (Express API) → Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Builder/Runner separation**: Untrusted build containers isolated from runtime containers
- **Origin isolation**: Previews served on separate subdomains (proj-*.domain.com)
- **Memory system**: CLAUDE.md files for persistent AI context across sessions
- **Security zones**: Docker networks isolate user containers from system components

## Key Decisions
- **2025-10-19**: Project initialized - chosen custom React implementation over ClaudeCodeUI fork to avoid GPL-3.0 viral licensing
- **2025-10-19**: Decided on security-first architecture with mandatory quota enforcement (not optional)
- **2025-10-19**: Implementing CLAUDE.md memory system as core differentiator from competitors
- **2025-10-19**: Using wildcard subdomains for preview isolation to prevent XSS attacks
- **2025-10-20**: Completed full-stack implementation - 20+ backend files, 15+ frontend components
- **2025-10-20**: Created comprehensive testing suite with automated E2E script
- **2025-10-20**: MVP uses simulated Claude responses - production will use real Anthropic API
- **2025-10-20**: Prioritized testing over remaining features (auth, templates, janitor) per user request

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety (frontend and backend where applicable)
- Async/await pattern for all asynchronous operations
- Error handling: Try-catch blocks with proper error logging
- File organization: Services for business logic, routes for API endpoints, middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Database queries: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Environment variables: Never commit .env files, use .env.example templates
- Comments: Inline comments for complex logic, JSDoc for function documentation

## Current Status
Last updated: 2025-10-22T07:10:00Z

**✅ MVP CORE FEATURES: 13/18 COMPLETE (72%)**

Phase 1 MVP progress against Planning/atlas-mvp-plan.md checklist:

**✅ Completed (13/18):**
1. Custom frontend (React+TypeScript, NOT ClaudeCodeUI fork)
2. Chat with Claude Code to build apps (streaming + tool visibility)
3. CLAUDE.md memory system (init/update/checkpoint/stats)
4. File tree + code editor (Monaco)
5. Live preview system (static + Docker previews with auto-refresh)
6. Docker-based deployment (builder/runner split with security hardening)
8. Project persistence (PostgreSQL with full schema)
10. Memory persistence across sessions (CLAUDE.md + snapshots)
11. ENFORCED resource quotas (hard stops via middleware)
12. Rate limiting & cost tracking (usage ledger)
13. Container security hardening (non-root, read-only FS, seccomp, etc.)
14. Port allocator + health checks (/health endpoint)
15. Minimal observability (events table + Winston structured logs)

**⚠️ Partial (1/18):**
7. Build orchestration (works but no Redis queue - builds execute directly)

**❌ Pending (4/18):**
9. Session management (JWT auth - currently mock auth)
16. Janitor service (nightly cleanup of containers/images/volumes)
17. Starter templates (Next.js, Vite+React, Express, Flask)
18. Debug surface (/debug page for ops)

**Recent Enhancements (2025-10-22):**
- ✅ Dev server preview system refinements (Start/Stop controls, auto-refresh)
- ✅ Intelligent preview type detection (dev server vs static vs Docker)
- ✅ React key-based iframe remounting for reliable preview updates
- ✅ Fixed dev server state synchronization between frontend and backend
- ✅ Contextual UI messages when dev server is stopped

**Previous Enhancements (2025-10-21):**

  - Added fileChangeCounter state in App.tsx
  - Implemented onFileChange callback propagation from ChatPanel
  - Detected file operation tools (Write, Edit, NotebookEdit) in Socket.IO stream
  - Used React key prop to force FileTree re-mount on changes
  - Added iframe reload logic in PreviewPanel with refreshKey prop
  - Committed changes (e63bce8)
- **08:00**: Fixed Claude directory restriction issue
  - User noticed Claude added continue button to its own code (ChatPanel.tsx)
  - Reverted self-modifications to ChatPanel
  - Added system instructions in backend/server.js to restrict Claude to project directory only
  - System instructions prepended to every chat message to enforce working directory boundaries
  - Prevents AI from modifying AtlasEngine codebase
  - Committed changes (e63bce8)
- **09:00**: Implemented static file preview server
  - Added Express static middleware route `/preview/:projectId` in backend/server.js
  - Serves HTML/CSS/JS files directly from project directories
  - PreviewPanel now shows static preview by default (no build/deploy needed)
  - Docker-based preview only used after explicit build/deploy
  - Enables instant preview of static HTML projects
  - Committed changes (f419c30)
- **10:00**: Fixed loading indicator persistence
  - Removed premature `setIsTyping(false)` from stream event handler
  - Loading dots now persist until claude-complete or claude-error event
  - Improves UX by showing continuous activity while Claude processes
  - Committed changes (f419c30)
- **12:30**: Reviewed progress against original plan (Planning/atlas-mvp-plan.md)
  - Compared completed features vs. Phase 1 MVP checklist (18 items)
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with progress tracking: 13/18 complete (72%)
  - Identified 4 remaining MVP features: JWT auth, janitor, templates, debug page
  - Reorganized future enhancements into clear priorities
- **12:30**: ✅ SESSION 5 COMPLETE - UX improvements and progress tracking updated

### Session 6: Preview System Refinements (2025-10-22)
- **06:30**: Fixed preview URL handling for dev server projects
  - Added `hasDevServerProject` state to distinguish dev server (Vite/Next.js) vs static projects
  - Shows helpful "Dev Server Stopped" message with inline start button when dev server stopped
  - Prevents showing broken static preview URLs for projects that require dev servers
  - URL bar now displays contextual messages: dev server URL, "Dev server stopped", or static URL
  - Committed changes (c3b3ad4)
- **06:45**: Implemented iframe auto-refresh on dev server start/stop
  - Added `iframeReloadKey` state for forcing iframe remounts
  - Used React key-based remounting instead of imperative src updates

  - Key increments on: start dev server, stop dev server, manual refresh
  - Committed changes (2af22bd, 5ffe1ca)
- **07:00**: Fixed dev server state synchronization (ROOT CAUSE)
  - **Issue**: Frontend checked `devServer.running` but backend only returned `status: 'running'` (string)

**Key Improvements:**
- Dev server projects now have clear UX when server is stopped
- Iframe auto-refresh works reliably via React key remounting
- Start/Stop button states sync correctly with backend
- Preview panel intelligently handles three preview types: dev server, Docker, and static

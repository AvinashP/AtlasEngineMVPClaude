# Session Summary - Foundation Setup

## Session Information
- **Date:** 2025-10-19
- **Duration:** ~30 minutes
- **Completed Task:** Step 1 - Project Structure Setup
- **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## What We Built

### 1. Complete Project Scaffold
- Backend directory structure with organized src/ folder
- Frontend directory structure following React best practices
- Docs, templates, and projects folders
- Proper .gitignore configuration

### 2. Backend Foundation
**File:** `backend/package.json`
- Configured with Express.js, Socket.io, PostgreSQL, Docker API
- Security packages: helmet, bcrypt, JWT, rate limiting
- Redis for build queue management
- Winston for structured logging

**File:** `backend/.env.example`
- 50+ environment variables documented
- Database, Redis, Docker configuration
- API keys, secrets, domains
- Quota and rate limit defaults
- Feature flags for phased rollout

### 3. Frontend Foundation
**File:** `frontend/package.json`
- React 18 + TypeScript setup
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- Socket.io client for real-time communication
- Vite for fast development builds
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management

### 4. Memory System (CRITICAL for Continuity)
**File:** `CLAUDE.md`
This is our **persistent AI memory** - essential for session continuity:
- Project overview and tech stack
- Architecture decisions
- Coding conventions
- Current implementation status
- Development progress log (timestamped)
- Security requirements checklist

**Purpose:** If we hit quota limits or context runs out, a new session can read this file and continue exactly where we left off.

### 5. Documentation
**File:** `README.md`
- Project overview with architecture diagram
- Installation and setup instructions
- Security features explanation
- Development roadmap

**File:** `docs/PROGRESS.md`
- Session-by-session progress tracking
- Detailed task completion status
- Next steps clearly defined
- "How to Resume" guide

**File:** `docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- Quick reference for what was accomplished

## Key Statistics

- **Files Created:** 8
- **Directories Created:** 15
- **Dependencies Defined:** ~30
- **Environment Variables:** 50+
- **Lines of Documentation:** ~600
- **Progress:** 4 of 24 major tasks completed (17%)

## Critical Files for Session Continuity

If you need to resume this project in a new session, read these files **in order**:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Full project context and memory
2. **`docs/PROGRESS.md`** - What's been completed
3. **`Planning/atlas-mvp-plan.md`** - Original blueprint
4. **`backend/.env.example`** - Configuration requirements

## What's NOT Done Yet

- ❌ Database schema not created
- ❌ No backend code written (just structure)
- ❌ No frontend code written (just structure)
- ❌ Dependencies not installed (npm install needed)
- ❌ No services implemented
- ❌ No API routes defined
- ❌ No UI components built

## Next Session Should Focus On

### Step 2: Database Setup (Highest Priority)

Create these files:
1. `backend/scripts/schema.sql` - Full database schema
2. `backend/src/db/connection.js` - PostgreSQL connection pool
3. `backend/src/db/queries.js` - Database query helpers

**Tables to Create:**
- users (authentication)
- projects (user projects)
- builds (build history)
- previews (active deployments)
- memory_snapshots (CLAUDE.md versions)
- user_quotas (resource limits)
- usage_ledger (billing/tracking)
- events (observability)

### Step 3: Core Services (After Database)

1. `backend/src/services/memoryService.js` - CLAUDE.md management
2. `backend/src/services/dockerService.js` - Container orchestration
3. `backend/src/services/portRegistry.js` - Port allocation + health checks
4. `backend/src/middleware/quotas.js` - Resource enforcement

## Commands to Run Next Session

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/avinash/Projects/AI/AtlasEngineMVP

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Create local environment file
cd ../backend
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with actual values

# Set up PostgreSQL database
createdb atlasengine
psql atlasengine < scripts/schema.sql
```

## Memory Update Instructions

After each major milestone, update `CLAUDE.md`:

1. Update "Current Status" section with completed tasks
2. Add timestamped entry to "Development Progress Log"
3. Update "Key Decisions" if architectural choices were made
4. Keep "Known Issues" current

This ensures continuity across sessions!

## Success Criteria for Step 1
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Package.json files configured
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Memory system (CLAUDE.md) initialized
- [x] Git configuration complete

**Result:** ✅ ALL CRITERIA MET - STEP 1 COMPLETE

## Important Notes

### Why We Haven't Run npm install Yet
We're setting up the structure first. Running `npm install` will be the first command in the next session before we start coding.

### Why No Code Yet
Step 1 is purely foundational - getting the scaffold right. Code implementation begins in Step 2 with the database layer.

### Memory System is Critical
The CLAUDE.md file is our **insurance policy** against:
- Token quota exhaustion
- Context window limits
- Session timeouts
- Needing to resume days/weeks later

**Always update it after significant progress!**

---

**Session Conclusion:** Foundation successfully established. Project is ready for database implementation and service development.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 5-6 weeks of focused development
**Current Progress:** ~4% (1 of 24 major tasks complete)
**Next Session ETA:** ~1-2 hours for database setup
